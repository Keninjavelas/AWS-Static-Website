# ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Static Website Deployment ‚Äì Phase 1 & 2

![Screenshot](./Screen.png)

---

## üß≠ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **static website on AWS** using **Amazon S3**, **CloudFront**, and **GitHub Actions CI/CD**.
It is part of my hands-on AWS learning path toward becoming a **Cloud Engineer / DevOps Engineer**.

---

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### **Phase 1 ‚Äì Static Website Hosting**

* Hosted HTML/CSS/JS website in **Amazon S3**
* Enabled **Static Website Hosting**
* Set proper **Bucket Policy** for public read access
* Verified via S3 website endpoint
  ‚Üí `http://my-first-aws-site-aryan.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/`

### **Phase 2 ‚Äì Global Distribution + Automation**

* Added **Amazon CloudFront CDN** in front of S3 for:

  * Faster global delivery
  * HTTPS + SSL encryption (via ACM)
* Configured **GitHub Actions** for automatic deployment:

  * On every push to `main` branch
  * Syncs repo files to S3
  * Automatically **invalidates CloudFront cache**
* Created a dedicated **IAM user** for GitHub Actions with:

  * `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  * `AmazonCloudFrontFullAccess`
* Stored credentials securely as **GitHub Secrets**
